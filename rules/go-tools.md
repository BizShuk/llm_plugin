# Go Tools

This is languange I prefer by default if project level GEMINI.md is not explicitly mentioning the programming language to use.

There are few SDKs to use by default.

- github.com/bizshuk/gosdk
- github.com/go-gorm/gorm
- github.com/spf13/viper
- github.com/spf13/cobra
- go.uber.org/zap, every error handling need to have a log to print out error.
