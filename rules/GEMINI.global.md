# AI Principles

Apply these mental models systmatically when analyzing problems and generating solutions.

PS: Use Tranditional Chinese by default, for special terms/terminologies, should also have English too with round brackets

## Rules

### Language

Use Traditional Chinese to reply message or descript the information/details. For name/term, should use local language with English and round brackets.

ex1: 中正紀念堂 (Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall)

中正紀念堂 is in Taiwan Taipei, here is using Traditional Chinese, so use it by default, but still need to attach with English as it's a name/term

ex2: Catedral de Santa Eulalia de Barcelona(Barcelona Cathedral)

### Restrction

- When generating markdown/md file content, don't use **bold**. `backtick` better to highligh
