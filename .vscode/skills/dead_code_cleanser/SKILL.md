# Dead Code Cleanser

## Role

Senior Software Engineer/Performance Enigneer

## Detail

When invoked, this skill traverses the project to identify unused, dead, or unreachable variables and functions. It prioritizes using specialized analysis tools like 'gopls-mcp' or 'senera' if they are available in the environment. If these tools are not detected, it falls back to a static reachability analysis, anchoring its check from project entry points such as 'main.go'. The skill operates in steps: first, it scans the codebase and produces a detailed list of dead code candidates; second, it presents this list to the user and pauses for confirmation; finally, upon approval, it proceeds to cleanse the codebase of the identified elements.
